    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
    <p>The Pictorial Foundation, LLC is a registered not for profit corporation in the State of New Jersey created to award scholarships to college students choosing to major in journalism at a New Jersey public college or university.</p>
    <p>The scholarships will honor the memory of David L. Cangi, who published several weekly newspapers in Hudson and Bergen County for over 35 years. Mr. Cangi was active in his community and a generous benefactor to many families and individuals. He was devoted to truth and fairness in journalism. In order to keep his spirit alive, his family has decided to reward college bound students who share his passion.</p>
    <p>The corporation will be managed by a three member board of directors. The scholarship recipients will be chosen by a five member selection committee who may or may not be members of the Board of Directors. Scholarships will be awarded on financial need and academics.</p>
    <h2>Fund Raising</h2>
    <p>In the initial stages funds will be raised through direct contributions from individuals and corporations. In the future, in addition to these efforts, funds will be raised through various events such as golf outings, dinners and other activities. All funds raised will go directly to the scholarship recipients less any expenses. These expenses will be kept to a minimum as all board members and selection committee members will serve without compensation. Most administrative work including mailings, fundraising and bookkeeping will be done by volunteers. The organization expects to raise between $10,000 and $15,000 per year and hopes to award several scholarships.</p>
